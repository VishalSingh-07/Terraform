### File-Provisioner

The file provisioner is used to copy files or directories from the machine executing Terraform to the newly created resource. The file provisioner supports both `ssh` and `winrm` type connections.

Let's modify **instance.tf** file to use file provisioner. and also create a **readme.md** file with any content because we are going to copy that file to remote instance.

```json
# Creating instance
resource "aws_instance" "terraform-first-instance" {
  ami                    = var.ami_id
  instance_type          = var.instance_type
  key_name               = aws_key_pair.key-terraform.key_name
  vpc_security_group_ids = ["${aws_security_group.terraform-security-group.id}"]
  tags = {
    Name = "terraform-first-instance"
  }
  user_data = file("${path.module}/script.sh")

  connection {
    type = "ssh"
    user = "ubuntu"
    private_key = file("${path.module}/id_rsa")
    host="${self.public_ip}"
  }
  
  # file, local-exec, and remote-exec
  provisioner "file" {
    source="readme.md" # terraform machine
    destination="/tmp/readme.md" # remote machine
    
  }
  provisioner "file" {
    content="this is test file" # terraform machine
    destination="/tmp/content.md" # remote machine
  }
}
```

```sh
vishalsingh@197NOMBT3987 15_file-provisioner % ssh -i id_rsa ubuntu@15.206.195.121

##### Directory Uploads
* The file provisioner is also able to upload a complete directory to the remote machine. When uploading a directory, there are a few important things you should know.
* First, when using the ssh connection type the destination directory must already exist. If you need to create it, use a remote-exec provisioner just prior to the file provisioner in order to create the directory.
* If the source is /foo (no trailing slash), and the destination is /tmp, then the contents of /foo on the local machine will be uploaded to /tmp/foo on the remote machine. The foo directory on the remote machine will be created by Terraform.
* If the source, however, is /foo/ (a trailing slash is present), and the destination is /tmp, then the contents of /foo will be uploaded directly into /tmp.
* This behavior was adopted from the standard behavior ofÂ rsync.

**Copying the directory:**
```json
# Creating instance
resource "aws_instance" "terraform-first-instance" {
  ami                    = var.ami_id
  instance_type          = var.instance_type
  key_name               = aws_key_pair.key-terraform.key_name
  vpc_security_group_ids = ["${aws_security_group.terraform-security-group.id}"]
  tags = {
    Name = "terraform-first-instance"
  }
  user_data = file("${path.module}/script.sh")

  connection {
    type = "ssh"
    user = "ubuntu"
    private_key = file("${path.module}/id_rsa")
    host="${self.public_ip}"
  }
  
  # file, local-exec, and remote-exec
  provisioner "file" {
    source="readme.md" # terraform machine
    destination="/tmp/readme.md" # remote machine
    
  }
  provisioner "file" {
    content="this is test file" # terraform machine
    destination="/tmp/content.md" # remote machine
  }

  # Copies the testFolder folder to /tmp/testFolder
  provisioner "file" {
    source = "testFolder" # terraform machine
    destination = "/tmp/" # remote machine
  }
}
```
