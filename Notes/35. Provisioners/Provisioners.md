### Provisioners

Provisioners are used to executing scripts on a local or remote machine as part of resource creation or destruction. Provisioners can be used to bootstrap a resource, cleanup before destroy, run configuration management, etc.

##### Creation-Time Provisioners:
* By default, provisioners run when the resource they are defined within is created. Creation-time provisioners are only run during creation, not during updating or any other lifecycle. They are meant as a means to perform bootstrapping of a system.
* If a creation-time provisioner fails, the resource is marked as **tainted**. A tainted resource will be planned for destruction and recreation upon the next terraform apply. Terraform does this because a failed provisioner can leave a resource in a semi-configured state. Because Terraform cannot reason about what the provisioner does, the only way to ensure proper creation of a resource is to recreate it. This is tainting.
* You can change this behavior by setting the `on_failure` attribute, which is covered in detail below.

**Example**
```json
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  # ...

  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "echo ${self.private_ip} > file.txt"
  }
}
```


##### Destroy-Time Provisioners:
* If when = "destroy" is specified, the provisioner will run when the resource it is defined within is destroyed.
* Destroy provisioners are run before the resource is destroyed. If they fail, Terraform will error and rerun the provisioners again on the next terraform apply. Due to this behavior, care should be taken for destroy provisioners to be safe to run multiple times.
* A destroy-time provisioner within a resource that is tainted will not run. This includes resources that are marked tainted from a failed creation-time provisioner or tainted manually using terraform taint.

**Example**
```json
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  # ...

  provisioner "local-exec" {
    when    = "destroy"
    command = "echo 'Destroy-time provisioner'"
  }
}
```

##### Multiple Provisioners:
* Multiple provisioners can be specified within a resource. Multiple provisioners are executed in the order they're defined in the configuration file.
* You may also mix and match creation and destruction provisioners. Only the provisioners that are valid for a given operation will be run. Those valid provisioners will be run in the order they're defined in the configuration file.

**Example**
```json
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  # ...

  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "echo first"
  }

  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "echo second"
  }
}
```


##### Failure Behavior:
* By default, provisioners that fail will also cause the Terraform apply itself to error. The `on_failure` setting can be used to change this. The allowed values are:
    * **continue** - Ignore the error and continue with creation or destruction.
    * **fail** - Error (the default behavior). If this is a creation provisioner, taint the resource.

**Example**
```json
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  # ...
  
provisioner "local-exec" {
    command    = "echo ${self.private_ip} > file.txt"
    on_failure = "continue"
  }
}
```
