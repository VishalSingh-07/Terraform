### AWS User Data Using Terraform

AWS **user data** isÂ the set of commands/data you can provide to a instance at launch time. For example if you are launching an ec2 instance and want to have docker installed on the newly launched ec2, than you can provide set of bash commands in the user data field of aws ec2 config page.

In this blog, we are going to assign user-data to AWS instance with the help of terraform.

lets create a file named **script.sh** with the below content.
```sh
#!/bin/bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nginx -y
sudo echo "Hi Vishal Singh ðŸ‘‹ " >/var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html
```


now modify **instance.tf** file with the below content, so we can use this script as user data.
```json
# Creating instance
resource "aws_instance" "terraform-first-instance" {
  ami                    = var.ami_id
  instance_type          = var.instance_type
  key_name               = aws_key_pair.key-terraform.key_name
  vpc_security_group_ids = ["${aws_security_group.terraform-security-group.id}"]
  tags = {
    Name = "terraform-first-instance"
  }
  user_data = file("${path.module}/script.sh")
}
```

now we can run terraform apply command and verify that the instance created and Nginx is also installed in that instance with the help of userdata. you can access it on port 80 by default.

```sh
vishalsingh@197NOMBT3987 14_aws-first-instance % terraform validate
Success! The configuration is valid.
```

```sh
vishalsingh@197NOMBT3987 14_aws-first-instance % terraform plan

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

Do you really want to destroy all resources?
  Terraform will destroy all your managed infrastructure, as shown above.
  There is no undo. Only 'yes' will be accepted to confirm.

Let's destroy first the already create infrastructure using the terraform destroy command and then again run terraform apply command you can verify that an instance, security group, and ssh key pair are created and the key-pair and security group attached to that instance.

Do you really want to destroy all resources?
  Terraform will destroy all your managed infrastructure, as shown above.
  There is no undo. Only 'yes' will be accepted to confirm.

  Enter a value: yes

aws_security_group.terraform-security-group: Destruction complete after 1s
